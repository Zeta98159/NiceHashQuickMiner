# Security Policy

## Overview

This Security Policy outlines the measures in place to protect NiceHashMiner from viral installations, corrupt code, and hostile user integrations that may compromise the integrity, legality, and safety of the software. Our goal is to ensure that NiceHashMiner remains secure, compliant with legal standards, and free from malicious threats. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in NiceHashMiner, please report it immediately to our security team via [security@nicehashminer.com](mailto:security@nicehashminer.com). We encourage responsible disclosure and will work promptly to address the issue.

## Secure Coding Practices

### 1. Code Review and Approval
- **Mandatory Peer Review**: All code contributions must undergo a mandatory peer review process by at least two experienced developers. This helps ensure that code quality standards are met and that no malicious code is introduced.
- **Automated Security Scans**: All pull requests are subject to automated security scans for vulnerabilities using tools such as SonarQube or similar.

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Trusted Sources**: Only use dependencies from trusted and verified sources. All third-party libraries must be vetted for security vulnerabilities before inclusion.
- **Regular Audits**: Dependencies must be regularly audited for known vulnerabilities using tools such as Dependabot or Snyk.

### 3. Code Signing
- **Digital Signatures**: All binaries distributed to end-users must be digitally signed using a secure code-signing certificate to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software.
- **Verification**: Users should verify the digital signature before executing any binaries to ensure that they are running legitimate, unaltered software.

## Preventing Viral Installations

### 1. Installer Security
- **No Bundled Software**: The NiceHashMiner installer must not include any bundled software or third-party applications. This prevents the installation of unwanted or malicious software.
- **Sandboxing**: The installation process should be sandboxed to limit the access and permissions granted to the installer, preventing it from making unauthorized changes to the system.

### 2. User Consent and Awareness
- **Explicit User Consent**: Users must provide explicit consent before any software is installed on their systems. This includes clear, non-deceptive prompts about what is being installed.
- **Transparent Privacy Policy**: A clear and concise privacy policy must be presented to the user, outlining what data is collected, how it is used, and how it is protected.

## Protecting Against Corrupt Code

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
- **Secure Build Environment**: Ensure that the build environment is secure, isolated, and regularly updated to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.
- **Immutable Builds**: Build artifacts should be immutable, meaning once they are created and signed, they cannot be altered.

### 2. Release Management
- **Release Verification**: Every release must be thoroughly tested and verified before being made public. This includes both automated tests and manual code reviews.
- **Checksum Validation**: Provide checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for all released binaries so that users can verify the integrity of the downloaded files.

## Mitigating Hostile User Integrations

### 1. Access Control
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Only provide the minimum necessary permissions to contributors, developers, and systems that interact with the NiceHashMiner codebase.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: All contributors with commit access must enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on their GitHub accounts to enhance security.

### 2. Contribution Guidelines
- **Code of Conduct**: All contributors must adhere to the project's Code of Conduct, which includes guidelines on ethical behavior, respect, and adherence to legal standards.
- **Prohibited Content**: Contributions that contain illegal, unethical, or hostile content will be rejected and may result in a ban from contributing to the project.

### 3. Monitoring and Incident Response
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring of the repository for unauthorized changes, security breaches, or suspicious activity.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to address security incidents swiftly and effectively. This includes steps for containment, investigation, mitigation, and communication.

## Legal Compliance

### 1. Compliance with Local Laws
- **Export Control Laws**: Ensure that NiceHashMiner complies with all relevant export control laws, particularly when distributing software internationally.
- **Data Protection Regulations**: Adhere to data protection regulations such as GDPR for European users, ensuring that personal data is handled legally and ethically.

### 2. License Compliance
- **Open Source Licenses**: Ensure that all code and dependencies comply with their respective open source licenses. Provide clear documentation of all licenses used within the project.

## Conclusion

Security is a top priority for the NiceHashMiner project. By following this security policy, we aim to protect our users, contributors, and the project itself from security threats, ensuring a safe and trustworthy mining experience for everyone.
